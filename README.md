Following this tutorial to give myself more of a foundation using an interface as well as practice DAILY learning. 
The goal is 3 hours a day on weekdays and 2 hours every weekend. 21 days of back-to-back work helps build the habit. 

I'm also going to improve the way I submit to Github. Now that i plan to work on this more often, 
I suppose it makes sense to have a repository act as a project, and the files can be uploaded there, rather than each file having its own project. 

Using README's as a way to document my own progress!
